# Annotators management

The **Annotators** tab in the **Project management** page allows the viewing and management of annotators in the project.

Add annotators to the project by clicking on the list of names in the <strong>right column</strong>. Current annotators
can be removed by clicking on the names in the <strong>left column</strong>. Removing annotators does not delete their
completed annotations but will stop their current pending annotation task.

An annotator can only be recruited into **one project at a time**.

Once an annotator has annotated a proportion of documents in the project (specified in project configuration), they will
be deemed to have completed all their annotation tasks and automatically be removed the project. This frees them to be
recruited in another project.
