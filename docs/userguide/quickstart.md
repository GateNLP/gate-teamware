# Quickstart

## Annotators

Annotating a project:

* After signing up to the site, notify the owner of the annotation project you've been recruited of 
  your username. This will allow them to add you as an annotator to a project.
* After you've been recruited to a project, click on the `Annotate` link on the navigation bar at the 
  top of the page to start annotating.
* You will be shown the details about the project you're annotating along with a set of form(s) to capture
  your annotation. Ensure you've read the Annotator guideline fully before starting the annotation process.
* You can then start annotating documents one at a time. Click on `Submit` to confirm the completion of 
  annotation, `Clear` to start again or `Reject` to skip the particular document. Be aware some projects 
  do not allow you to skip documents.
* Once you've finished annotating a certain number of documents in a project (specified by the project 
  manager) your task will be deemed complete, and you will be able to be recruited into another annotation 
  project.
