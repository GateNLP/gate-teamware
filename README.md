## Django settings files

Django settings are located in `annotation_tool/setttings` folder. The app will use `base.py` setting by default
and this must be overridden depending on use.

### Secret

A `secret.py` should be created to hold settings that should not be made public by tracking through version
control. A `secret_default.py` exists as a guide and to provide default value for testing.
